    "## Notes on Tree-based Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosted Trees is another ensemble method, similar to a Random Forest algorithm. This means several tree-like models are trained in parallel and are all used to contribute to a final prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Random Forest (RF), the first step is to produce a bootstrapped dataset (sampling with replacement). We then build a decision tree using this bootstrapped dataset - crucially, we use a random subset of the features at each step rather than the entire feature space. These 2 steps are repeated to produce a 'forest' of these random trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forests on New Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new piece of data is passed through a RF, each tree provides an answer. In classification this could be yes/no, in regression this could be a continuous variable, like price. Once all the trees have given an answer, the final prediction is either the mode (in classification) or the mean (in regression) - this technique is called *bagging*. An out-of-bag score can then be calculated - the out-of-bag dataset are the examples that were not selected in the bootstrapping stage and acts as a validation set like in Cross Validation. In classification, the proportion of out-of-bag samples that were *incorrectly* classified is known as the out-of-bag error \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Trees\n",
    "The inital root for a regression tree is the threshold for a feature which minimises the sum of the squared residuals. Each leaf continues in this fashion until the tree can no longer be split. To prevent overfitting, the algorithm typically has a min_samples_split hyperparameter. This prevents a split with a single observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# <a href=\"https://jerryfriedman.su.domains/ftp/trebst.pdf\">Gradient Boosted Trees</a>\n",
    "## Regression\n",
    "Gradient Boost (GB) starts with a single leaf for the inital guess - for a continuous variable, this will be the average of the target. From this inital guess, GB trees are constructed but their overall size (number of leaves) is limited - typically this is between 8 and 32. Each successive tree is built upon the previous trees errors and once the maximum number of trees are constructed, a linear combination of these trees are utilised to make predictions. Each successive tree is scaled by the same amount - a constant usually defined as the learning rate or $\\eta$.\n",
    "\n",
    " **AdaBoost** is a similar boosted tree algorithm - in this, however, the trees that are constructed are actually 'stumps' (this means a root and a single left and right leaf). Not only that but each successive stump is individually scaled based on how well it performed, rather than scalling all trees by a fixed $\\eta$\n",
